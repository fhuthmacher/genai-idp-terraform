# Native `terraform test` for the root PRIVATE endpoint-gap validation
# (the `check "private_api_endpoint_present"` block in network.tf).
#
# Verifies the check fails if and only if the REST API visibility is PRIVATE AND
# the `execute-api` interface VPC endpoint is absent from the provisioned set
# (the keys of `module.vpc_endpoints[0].interface_endpoint_ids`). On every other
# path (GLOBAL/unset, or PRIVATE *with* the execute-api endpoint present) the
# check holds.
#
# v0.6.4: upstream replaced AppSync with the API Gateway REST transport, so the
# endpoint this gap guards is `execute-api` (was `appsync-api`), the derived local
# is `local.api_visibility_private` (was `appsync_visibility_private`), and the
# supported input is `api.api_gateway_visibility` (was `api.visibility`).
#
# How the gap arises (and why this is the faithful gap case):
#   network.tf wires `_vpc_endpoint_execute_api = api_visibility_private ?
#   { execute-api = true } : {}` into `required_interface_endpoints`, so whenever
#   a private-network deployment is active AND visibility is PRIVATE the
#   execute-api endpoint is *always* provisioned. The only way to reach
#   "PRIVATE without execute-api" is therefore the operator-error case the check
#   exists to catch: visibility set to PRIVATE while no private-network
#   deployment is configured (var.private_network = null / empty subnets), so
#   `module.vpc_endpoints` is count = 0 and the provisioned set is empty ({}).
#   That is exactly the iff boundary this test pins.
#
# check{}-vs-expect_failures note (same mechanism as exactly-one-processor.tftest):
#   A `check {}` assertion failure is only a plan *warning* in a normal plan, but
#   `terraform test`'s `expect_failures = [check.<name>]` is the first-class way
#   to assert a check failed during `command = plan`: the run PASSES iff the named
#   check reported a failure, and FAILS if the check unexpectedly held. The PRIVATE
#   gap case is asserted via `expect_failures`; the passing cases assert the plan
#   is clean (no expect_failures) plus the relevant endpoint-set keys.
#
# Offline harness (identical to the other root tests): aws + an aliased
# aws.us-east-1 provider are mocked (mock_data supplies real partition/region/
# account so AWS ARN-partition validation passes); awscc is mocked; the archive
# provider zips Lambda sources from the read-only `sources/` snapshot for real;
# random_string.suffix is pinned at plan so suffix-embedded resource names (and
# the SageMaker hook-count path) are known at plan. web_ui + api.enabled are
# false so the only validations in play are the processor + private-network
# checks — the API module is never instantiated, so this stays a faithful
# ROOT-level test of the gap check rather than of API-module internals
# (api visibility is read by the check directly, independent of api.enabled).
