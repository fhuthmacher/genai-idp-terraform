"""Stickler version tracking.

Derived from the installed distribution metadata at import time. A hand-maintained
constant here (as this module previously carried) drifted from what was actually
installed — the source of truth is the resolver, not a Python literal. Keep the
``stickler-eval==`` pins in ``pyproject.toml`` and ``setup.py`` aligned; a unit
test asserts they agree with what's installed.
