"""Stickler raw ``compare_with`` dict → IDP dataclasses.

Encodes R3: verdicts / counts / derived metrics come straight from Stickler's
``confusion_matrix`` (per-field ``fields[name].overall`` cells + section
``aggregate``). No re-scoring, no private threshold table. IDP dataclasses
receive whatever Stickler said — the two paths that used to disagree (per-doc
IDP re-derivation vs. run-level Stickler counts on the aggregation Lambda)
are now the same numbers by construction.

Kept module-boundary-clean: this module knows about Stickler's result shape
and IDP's dataclasses, but not about ``EvaluationService`` state or
orchestration. The service provides ``field_config``, ``match_threshold``,
``is_auto_generated``, and small callbacks; this module returns a fully-built
``SectionEvaluationResult``.

    Stickler's ``field_comparisons`` dicts carry only expected/actual keys,

    nested field are computed internally and dropped. Re-derive them by
    walking the translated schema to the leaf so the Nested Field Comparison
    table (and the Visual Editor overlay) can show the same Method/Weight
    columns as the top-level attributes table.

    Threshold source of truth: when ``root_model_cls`` is supplied,
    the per-leaf threshold is read from
    ``model_fields[…].json_schema_extra._threshold`` on the Stickler model —
    the value ``ComparableField`` stashed at build time and the one Stickler's
    ``ConfigurationHelper`` uses at compare time. This makes the Method
    column agree with Stickler's ``"below threshold (X < Y)"`` reason string
    even for fields where the operator wrote a bare method annotation with no
    explicit threshold (Stickler defaults 0.5; ``_format_evaluation_method``
    previously guessed 0.7 from a hardcoded per-method table that has since
    been removed). Schema-based lookup is kept as a fallback for callers
    that don't thread the model class through.

    UPSTREAM: candidate for `awslabs/stickler` — emit comparator name +
    weight + threshold + list_match_threshold on every ``field_comparisons``
    row so downstream renderers don't have to re-walk the schema. Delete this
    function (and ``resolve_leaf_schema`` / ``resolve_leaf_model_field``)
    once upstream carries the metadata. No open issue yet — file one if this
    branch survives beyond one Stickler upgrade.

        field_schema: Translated schema for the (array or object) attribute.
