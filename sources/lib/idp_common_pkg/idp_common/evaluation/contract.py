"""Cross-Lambda contract for the evaluation pipeline.

The evaluation service (``EvaluationService`` in ``service.py``) writes
per-doc ``results.json`` files that the ``test_execution_aggregation_function``
Lambda reads. Both sides live in different packages / deploy artifacts; the
shape of what they exchange (``stickler_comparison_result`` blob, the
``compare_with`` flag set that produced it, and the S3 key template) is a
de-facto API. This module makes the contract explicit so a shape change fails
loudly at read time rather than as wrong dashboard numbers downstream.

Bump ``STICKLER_RESULT_VERSION`` on any change that alters the raw blob shape
Stickler emits (a stickler-eval upgrade, a new ``compare_with`` flag, a
different accumulator). The aggregation Lambda can key off it to reject
mismatched blobs (or migrate) instead of silently doubling counters.
