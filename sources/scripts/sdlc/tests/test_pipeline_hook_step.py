"""Offline tests for Step 14, the pipeline-hook end-to-end CI step.

Step 14 itself needs a live stack, so what is testable here is the part that
fails *silently in CI* if it is wrong — the hook Lambda's package and its handler
logic. Both bugs these tests pin were real, found while writing the step:

1. **The zip built without pydantic.** The first version located dependencies by
   assuming they were siblings of `idp_common` in one site-packages directory.
   With an editable install they are not, so it produced a zip containing
   `idp_common` but no `pydantic` — which imports fine locally and dies with
   `ModuleNotFoundError` only at Lambda cold start, in CI.

2. **The marker was written to a field that is never serialized.** The handler
   first wrote its marker into `Document.metadata`, which `Document.to_dict()`
   drops entirely — so the mutation could never reach the persisted document and
   the step's central assertion would always have failed.

Together these are the "does the test itself work" layer: a broken Step 14 that
always fails is noisy, but a broken Step 14 that always *passes* would be worse
than having no test at all.
