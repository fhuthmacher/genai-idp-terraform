"""Flag DynamoDB filtered `Scan` calls that cannot see all their matches.

A filtered `Scan` is the wrong shape whenever you need *matches* rather than a
sample. DynamoDB applies both `Limit` and the implicit 1MB page size to the
items it **examines**, not to the items that pass `FilterExpression`, so:

    resp = table.scan(FilterExpression=..., Limit=10)   # WRONG
    if resp["Items"]: ...

finds a match only when it happens to fall inside the examined window. The row
count needed to break it is data-dependent and grows over time, so this fails
*silently* and *later* — typically on the longest-lived stack. It has now bitten
this codebase repeatedly, with symptoms as unalike as "configuration appears
empty", "a list view shows fewer rows than exist", and "pipeline hooks stop
firing" (issue #599). In every case the fix was to page.

This check enforces that every filtered `.scan(...)` call site either:

  * paginates — the enclosing function *uses* `LastEvaluatedKey` /
    `ExclusiveStartKey` (the loop may live a few lines away, so the check is
    function-scoped rather than expression-scoped); or
  * is explicitly marked as a deliberate bounded sample, with a reason:

        # filtered-scan-ok: sampling one row to detect whether backfill ran

The marker is deliberately verbose and requires prose after the colon, so
silencing the check is a conscious act that leaves a reviewable justification.

Two subtleties, both learned the hard way:

1. `FilterExpression` is resolved through **splatted kwargs**. The paginating
   idiom builds its arguments in a dict (`kw = {...}; table.scan(**kw)`), which
   is exactly what every fix for #599 does — so a checker that only reads literal
   keywords sees no arguments at all and skips precisely the call sites it exists
   to protect. See _splatted_kwarg_keys.
2. Evidence of paging must be a *use*, not a mention. A bare
   `_x = "LastEvaluatedKey"` does nothing; and a boto3 paginator pages the call
   made *through* it, saying nothing about a sibling `table.scan(...)`. See
   _paginates.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/check_filtered_scans.py            # whole repo
    python3 scripts/check_filtered_scans.py path/...   # specific files/dirs

Exit codes:
    0 - no unpaginated filtered scans
    1 - one or more found

    Without resolving that dict the checker sees NO keywords at all and silently
    skips the call — which made it blind to the exact call sites it was added to
    protect (every fix for issue #599 uses this form). So: for each `**name`, walk
    the enclosing function for `name = {...}` assignments and `name["key"] = ...`
    subscript stores, and collect their string keys.

    Deliberately shallow — no dataflow, no branch awareness. It over-approximates
    (a key assigned on one path counts everywhere), which is the safe direction:
    over-approximating `FilterExpression` means we ANALYZE the call rather than
    skip it, and the pagination check then decides. Nothing is suppressed by it.
