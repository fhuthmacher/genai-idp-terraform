Mandatory security-focused API test cases for the IDP UI REST API.

These implement the AppSec "Minimum Mandatory Security Focused Test Cases for
APIs" checklist as live suites layered on top of the RBAC/authorization matrix
in ``scripts/test_api_rbac.py``. That harness already covers checklist items
**1** (unauthenticated access denied) and **2 / 2.2** (the full role permission
matrix, negative + positive) via ``run_group_matrix`` + ``run_token_negatives``.
This module adds the remaining items:

  * **2.1  IDOR** — a second user (User B) must not read/modify User A's data.
  * **2.3  Token expiry** — an expired token is rejected (structural + optional
           live wait via ``IDP_SECTEST_WAIT_EXPIRY``).
  * **2.4  Logout revocation** — after global sign-out, a previously-issued
           token's continued acceptance is observed and reported (Cognito JWTs
           are stateless: this is expected to be a documented finding unless the
           API checks token revocation).
  * **2.5  Deleted-resource access** — a deleted resource is no longer readable.
  * **3    Input validation** — wrong-typed / malformed / unknown arguments are
           rejected. Tolerant by default (accepts today's 400-or-500); set
           ``IDP_SECTEST_STRICT_INPUT`` to require a clean 4xx (the behavior
           PR B / central schema validation introduces).
  * **4    TLS** — TLS 1.0 / 1.1 and plaintext HTTP must be refused; only
           TLS 1.2+ is accepted.

Design notes
------------
* The functions take the harness's ``call``/``record`` callables (dependency-
  injected) so this module has no import cycle with ``test_api_rbac.py`` and can
  be unit-tested with fakes.
* Every check is recorded via the same ``_record`` shape the RBAC harness uses,
  so results flow into the existing report/summary unchanged. A check maps to a
  ``known_gap`` id (documented, WARN not FAIL) when the current backend behavior
  is a known/accepted limitation (e.g. stateless-JWT logout).
* Second user (User B) creation/teardown is owned by ``test_api_rbac.py``'s
  setup/teardown; this module only drives requests with the tokens it's given.

    The security property under test is **non-disclosure**: whatever the backend
    returns to User B for User A's object id, it must NOT contain User A's data.
    We assert on the RESPONSE BODY, not the status code, because the resolver's
    ownership defense can surface as 200-empty, 403, or a 500 "not found for this
    user" — all acceptable (no disclosure); only User A's marker appearing in
    User B's response is a real leak.

    Uses agent jobs, whose ownership is enforced by construction: the resolver
    derives the DynamoDB partition key from the CALLER's identity and uses the
    supplied jobId only as the sort key, so User B's read of A's jobId resolves
    under B's own (empty) partition. ``seed_fn(job_id, marker) -> owner_user_id``
    seeds a job owned by User A directly in the agent table (injected by the
    harness; returns None if it can't seed, e.g. table not present -> SKIP).
