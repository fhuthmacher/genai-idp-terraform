# Native `terraform test` for managed-config seeding.
#
# Verifies that managed config rows are non-editable and that seeding is
# additive. What is provable offline (mock_provider + command = plan):
#
#   * managed rows carry `managed: true`: every
#     `aws_lambda_invocation.seed_managed` input decodes to an object with
#     `Managed == true` and `IsActive == false`. The seeder Lambda stamps
#     the DynamoDB `Managed` attribute from that input (see
#     src/lambda/configuration-seeder/index.py `_put_config_default`), and the
#     UPSTREAM config-write path rejects edits to `managed: true` rows. That
#     upstream enforcement lives in read-only `sources/` Python and cannot be
#     unit-tested here — it is documented, not asserted (see notes below).
#
#   * the for_each covers exactly the managed_config subdirs present in
#     `sources/config_library/managed_config/*/config.yaml` — no more, no
#     fewer.
#
#   * seeding is additive: the `seed_managed` invocations are separate
#     resources from `seed_default` / `seed_schema`. The pre-existing
#     consumer-row seeding (`seed_default`) carries NO `Managed` flag, so
#     non-managed rows are untouched and only managed rows add the marker.
#
# Offline harness: the aws provider is mocked. The `seed_managed` `input` is
# `jsonencode(...)` over `yamldecode(file(...))` of the read-only snapshot —
# all known at `command = plan` with no AWS credentials and no apply. The
# `aws_lambda_invocation` resources are NOT executed at plan time, so their
# `input` (a configured argument, not a computed result) is fully resolvable.
