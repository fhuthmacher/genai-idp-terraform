# Native `terraform test` for the tracking-gsi-backfill module.
#
# Verifies the GSI backfill is default-off, never auto-runs, and its roles are
# least-privilege.
#
#   * default-off: the *default-off gating lives at the ROOT*, not in this
#     module. The module itself has no enable flag — it is always "on" when
#     instantiated, and the root gates it via
#     `count = try(var.tracking.enable_gsi_backfill, false) ? 1 : 0` on
#     `module.tracking_gsi_backfill` (features.tf). So `enable_gsi_backfill =
#     false` ⇒ count 0 ⇒ neither the worker Lambda nor the state machine is
#     created. That root-count behavior is a `count` on a module block and is
#     verified by the root `terraform plan`/validate; this module test covers the
#     complementary half: the "on" shape, the no-auto-start guarantee, and the
#     least-privilege scoping.
#
#   * on-shape: instantiating the module yields BOTH the `backfill_worker` Lambda
#     and the `backfill` Step Functions state machine.
#
#   * never auto-runs: the worker is driven *only* by the Step Functions state
#     machine (the rendered SFN definition references exactly the worker's ARN),
#     and the module declares NO `aws_lambda_invocation`, `null_resource`, or any
#     other auto-start/trigger resource. The latter is a STATIC guarantee: there
#     is no such resource address to assert on, and referencing one would be a
#     configuration error caught by `make validate`. `make check-sources`/grep
#     over the module confirms zero
#     `aws_lambda_invocation`/`null_resource`/`local-exec`. Applying the module
#     creates the machinery only; the operator triggers the run explicitly.
#
#   * least-privilege:
#       - the WORKER role's policy has NO wildcard ("*") resource on ANY
#         statement; its DynamoDB statement is scoped to exactly the tracking
#         table ARN (+ `/index/*`) and its KMS statement to exactly the
#         encryption key ARN.
#       - the STATE-MACHINE role's `lambda:InvokeFunction` statement is scoped to
#         exactly the worker Lambda ARN (never "*").
#         IMPORTANT EXCEPTION: the state-machine policy also carries CloudWatch
#         vended-log-delivery (`logs:CreateLogDelivery`, …) and X-Ray
#         (`xray:PutTraceSegments`, …) statements that legitimately require
#         `Resource = "*"` — those actions are NOT resource-scopable (a documented
#         AWS requirement, carried with a `#tfsec:ignore` annotation in main.tf
#         and mirroring the wrapper's other logged state machines). So "no
#         wildcard" is asserted ONLY on the SCOPABLE statement
#         (`lambda:InvokeFunction`), never blanket across the SFN policy.
#
# Offline harness: the aws + time providers are mocked. The worker policy is
# `jsonencode(...)` over the worker log-group ARN (computed) plus the input
# tracking-table/KMS ARNs; the SFN policy is `jsonencode(...)` over the worker
# Lambda ARN (computed). Because those resource ARNs are computed attributes, the
# runs use `command = apply` so the mock provider materializes them and the
# policy JSON is fully known for `jsondecode`-based assertions (per the testing
# guidance that computed ARNs require apply even when mocked).

# Several resources validate that computed ARNs are well-formed: the Lambda
# validates its execution-role ARN, the state machine validates its `role_arn`
# and its `logging_configuration.log_destination` (the log-group ARN + ":*").
# The default mock provider returns a random short string for computed
# attributes, which fails those validations on apply, so the IAM role ARN, the
# Lambda ARN, and the log-group ARN are overridden with valid ARNs. (The policies
# under test are unaffected — they are `jsonencode`d from those ARNs and the
# input table/KMS ARNs.)
