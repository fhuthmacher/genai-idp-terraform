# Native `terraform test` for the shared unified-processor engine: BDA vs
# step-by-step pipeline routing.
#
# The engine deploys BOTH branches unconditionally and routes per document at
# RUNTIME, on the `use_bda` flag of the config version the document is pinned to
# (see `RouteByProcessingMode`, and the `count = 1` note at the top of
# lambda_bda.tf). There is deliberately no `use_bda` input variable: a single
# deployment must be able to serve a BDA config version and a Bedrock-LLM config
# version at the same time, so the branch cannot be selected at plan time.
#
# This file previously asserted the opposite — that `use_bda = false` omitted the
# BDA Lambdas and started the machine at OCRStep. That predates the
# always-both-branches refactor, and the assertions had gone permanently red.
# They are rewritten here to pin the behaviour the engine actually has.
#
# Offline by design: the AWS provider is mocked so the suite runs with no AWS
# credentials and no network. `command = plan` is used throughout — assertions
# target input-derived resource counts and the routing-topology outputs, which
# the mock provider makes known at plan time. The real `archive`/`time`/`null`
# providers stay live so the `archive_file` data sources also verify that every
# `sources/patterns/unified/...` path resolves.

# The mocked AWS provider must return a valid partition/region/account for the
# many `arn:${data.aws_partition.current.partition}:...` interpolations, or the
# AWS provider's ARN validation rejects the random mock values at plan time.
