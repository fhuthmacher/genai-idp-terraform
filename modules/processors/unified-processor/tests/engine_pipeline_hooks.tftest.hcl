# Native `terraform test` for the IDP v0.6 flat hook points (`preprocessing` and
# `postprocessing`) and the shared workflow tail they introduce.
#
# What this guards:
#
#   1. The two flat hook points are ALWAYS rendered, in every combination of
#      summarization / evaluation / HITL. Upstream renders them unconditionally
#      (they are inert until a config version populates the section), and a
#      config-dependent hook point would silently skip customer hooks.
#
#   2. The state graph stays CLOSED. Every path that used to terminate at
#      WorkflowComplete now funnels through PostprocessingHook via a per-edge
#      normalizer Pass, and which normalizer renders depends on the
#      summarization/evaluation combination. Step Functions only rejects a
#      dangling `Next` at CreateStateMachine time — i.e. during apply, against a
#      real account. Asserting closure at plan time catches it here instead.
#
# Offline by design: the AWS provider is mocked, so the suite needs no
# credentials and no network. `command = plan` throughout — the assertions target
# the routing-topology outputs, which derive from literal state names and are
# therefore known at plan (the full `definition` string is not: it interpolates
# computed Lambda ARNs).
