# Pipeline Hooks Dispatcher
#
# The dispatcher Lambda understands two families of extension point:
#
#   * six per-step points, configured as `<step>.postHook` lists — postOcr,
#     postClassification, postExtraction, postAssessment, postRuleValidation,
#     postSummarization;
#   * two FLAT points added in IDP v0.6, configured as standalone top-level
#     config sections rather than lists — `preprocessing` (runs FIRST, before
#     the BDA/pipeline routing decision) and `postprocessing` (runs LAST, after
#     evaluation, on the shared tail).
#
# It reads the active configuration version from the ConfigurationTable and
# fans out to the registered hook Lambdas. Inert by default: with no hook
# configured the dispatcher returns after a single config read and the pipeline
# is unchanged. Mirrors upstream IDP v0.6.4 (patterns/unified).
#
# NOTE: this workflow's state machine (main.tf) wires all SIX per-step hook
# points — postOcr, postClassification, postExtraction, postAssessment,
# postRuleValidation, postSummarization. `postRuleValidation` fires from the
# PostRuleValidationHook state inside the rule-validation sub-flow
# (`local.rv_states`), which is rendered only when var.enable_rule_validation is
# set; when rule validation is disabled the point is simply never reached (the
# dispatcher stays inert either way). The rule-validation states mirror
# upstream's ASL (RuleValidation -> RuleValidationOrchestration ->
# PostRuleValidationHook), adapted to this port's `$.Result.document` envelope.
