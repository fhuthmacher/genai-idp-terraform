# Inputs for the MCP-integration feature-plugin submodule.
#
# This submodule is a self-contained auxiliary feature: it provisions the
# Bedrock AgentCore Gateway MCP stack — the `agentcore_mcp_handler` Lambda, the
# gateway-manager custom-resource Lambda, the gateway execution role, the
# AgentCore Gateway (via a CloudFormation custom resource), the Cognito OAuth
# external app client, and the OAuth resource server + connector client — then
# emits a feature-plugin `contract` that `processing-environment-api` composes.
#
# The submodule is only instantiated when MCP is enabled (default-off; the root
# count-gates it on the forwarded `var.api.enable_mcp` flag). A GovCloud guard
# disables every resource when the deployment region is `us-gov-*`, regardless
# of the enable flag.

variable "enabled" {
  description = <<-EOT
    Whether MCP integration is requested. The root forwards
    `var.api.enable_mcp` here. Even when true, the GovCloud guard disables all
    resources in `us-gov-*` regions (AgentCore is unavailable there).

variable "name_prefix" {
  description = <<-EOT
    Name prefix for MCP resources (Lambdas, roles, gateway). Mirrors the
    `processing-environment-api` API name so resource names share the
    `<api_name>-agentcore-*` shape.

variable "user_pool_available" {
  description = <<-EOT
    Whether a Cognito User Pool will exist for this deployment.

    Must be derived from CONFIGURATION by the caller (a supplied user-identity
    object, or the count of the user-identity module), never from the pool ID
    itself. On a fresh deploy `user_pool_id` is a computed attribute of a module
    created in the same apply, so it is unknown at plan time and
    `user_pool_id != null` is unknown too — which fails the plan with "Invalid
    count argument ... cannot be determined until apply" on the resource server
    and connector client below.

    Defaults to null, which falls back to the `user_pool_id != null` test so
    existing callers keep working; that fallback is only safe when the pool ID is
    already known (an externally supplied pool).

    placeholder. Wire to the CloudFront distribution URL for cleanest behaviour.
