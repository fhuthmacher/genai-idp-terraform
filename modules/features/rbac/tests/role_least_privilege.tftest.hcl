# Native `terraform test` for the RBAC submodule — the user-management
# execution role is least-privilege.
#
# Verifies the user-management role's inline policy grants NO wildcard ("*")
# resource on the Cognito-admin actions or the Users-table actions. The Cognito
# statement is scoped to exactly the supplied user-pool ARN and the DynamoDB
# statement is scoped to exactly the Users table ARN (+ its index), never "*".
#
# This file is COMPLEMENTARY to groups.tftest.hcl (four groups, default/override
# names), which it does not touch. `terraform test` runs both.
#
# Offline harness: the aws provider is mocked. The inline policy
# (`aws_iam_role_policy.user_management.policy`) is `jsonencode(...)` over the
# Users-table ARN, the log-group ARN, and the (input-derived) user-pool ARN.
# Because those resource ARNs are computed attributes, the runs use
# `command = apply` so the mock provider materializes them and the policy JSON
# is fully known for `jsondecode`-based assertions (per the testing guidance
# that computed ARNs require apply even when mocked).

# The Lambda resource validates that its execution-role ARN is a well-formed
# ARN. The default mock provider returns a random short string for computed
# attributes, which fails that validation on apply, so the IAM role's `arn` is
# overridden with a valid ARN. (The policy under test is unaffected — it is
# `jsonencode`d from the Users-table/log-group ARNs and the user-pool ARN.)
