    List of security group IDs to associate with the interface endpoints. This module does
    not manage the security group; the caller owns it. The SG MUST allow inbound HTTPS (TCP
    443) from the VPC CIDR, not just from the Lambda SG. In-VPC browser clients (WorkSpaces,
    VPN, bastion) send REST API requests directly to the `execute-api` interface endpoint,
    so an SG that only permits 443 from the Lambda SG leaves the UI hanging when
    `api.api_gateway_visibility = "PRIVATE"` (this is the upstream IDP 0.5.15 "VpcCidr"
    fix, carried forward to the v0.6.4 REST transport). See
    `examples/bedrock-llm-processor-vpc` for a reference SG that opens 443 from the VPC
    CIDR.
