# Migrating from v0.5.16-tf.x to v0.6.4-tf.0

Upstream IDP v0.6.x is a large release: the web/API transport changed, several
hosting and configuration surfaces were reshaped, and some subsystems were
deleted outright. This guide covers the wrapper-side migration for each breaking
change, with the exact commands to run.

Read the whole section that applies to your deployment **before** running
`terraform apply`. Several of these changes destroy real infrastructure.

## New requirement: Terraform >= 1.7

The root module now declares `required_version = ">= 1.7.0"` (raised from
`>= 1.0`). This release ships `removed` blocks with a
`lifecycle { destroy = true }` argument, which Terraform only understands from
1.7 onward. In practice the floor was already 1.5, because the root module has
used `check {}` blocks for several releases.

```bash
terraform version   # must report >= 1.7.0
```

## Breaking changes in this release

| Processor inputs collapsed into one `processor` variable | documented below |
| ALB Web UI hosting removed (`web_ui.hosting = "ALB"`) | documented below |
| API Gateway Web UI hosting (`web_ui.hosting = "APIGateway"`) | documented below |
| AppSync GraphQL transport replaced by API Gateway REST | TODO |
| `api.visibility` renamed to `api.api_gateway_visibility` | documented below |
| `EnableHeadless` renamed to `EnableJobsApi` upstream | no action — see below |
| Step models come from the config only (all `*_model_id` + `model_id` removed) | **action may be required — see below** |
| Feature enablement comes from the config (summarization/evaluation/rule_validation/hitl/ocr.backend toggles removed) | **action may be required — see below** |
| Seeder preserves operator-edited configuration | documented below |
| Configuration / feature-parity changes | TODO |

The TODO rows are filled in by the remaining sub-steps of this migration; they
are listed here so the shape of the release is visible up front.

## Processor inputs collapsed into one `processor` variable

### What changed and why

A deployment always runs exactly one processor, but the old inputs modeled that
as three separate optional variables (`bedrock_llm_processor`, `bda_processor`,
`sagemaker_udop_processor`) with a plan-time check that exactly one was set. That
let you configure zero or two by mistake, and it did not match the single
`processor` naming used elsewhere. They are now one required `processor` object
with a `type` field that selects the processor.

### What you need to do

Move your old block under `processor` and add `type`. Nothing else about the
fields changes; the per-type fields keep the same names.

Bedrock LLM:

```hcl
# before
bedrock_llm_processor = {
  classification_model_id = "us.amazon.nova-lite-v1:0"
  extraction_model_id     = "us.amazon.nova-lite-v1:0"
  config                  = local.config
}

# after
processor = {
  type                    = "bedrock-llm"
  classification_model_id = "us.amazon.nova-lite-v1:0"
  extraction_model_id     = "us.amazon.nova-lite-v1:0"
  config                  = local.config
}
```

BDA (`project_arn` required):

```hcl
# before
bda_processor = {
  project_arn = awscc_bedrock_data_automation_project.bda_project.project_arn
  config      = local.config
}

# after
processor = {
  type        = "bda"
  project_arn = awscc_bedrock_data_automation_project.bda_project.project_arn
  config      = local.config
}
```

SageMaker UDOP (`classification_endpoint_arn` required):

```hcl
# before
sagemaker_udop_processor = {
  classification_endpoint_arn = aws_sagemaker_endpoint.udop_endpoint.arn
  config                      = local.config
}

# after
processor = {
  type                        = "sagemaker-udop"
  classification_endpoint_arn = aws_sagemaker_endpoint.udop_endpoint.arn
  config                      = local.config
}
```

### No state migration

This is an input-surface rename only. The internal module block names
(`module.bedrock_llm_processor`, `module.bda_processor`,
`module.sagemaker_udop_processor`) are unchanged, so every resource address
stays the same. You do not need `moved {}` blocks, and `terraform plan` after
the rename shows no adds, changes, or destroys for the processor resources.

---

## ALB Web UI hosting removed

### What changed and why

Upstream deleted ALB Web UI hosting in IDP v0.6.0. The `WebUIHosting=ALB`
parameter value, the `nested/alb-hosting/` stack, and every `ALB*` parameter are
gone from the upstream template, replaced by `WebUIHosting=APIGateway`. The
wrapper follows upstream, so in v0.6.4-tf.0:

- `modules/web-ui-alb/` is deleted.
- The root `module "web_ui_alb"`, `aws_s3_bucket_policy.web_ui_alb`, the
  `check "web_ui_alb_inputs"` validation, and the `web_ui_alb` output are gone.
- `web_ui.alb = { ... }` is no longer a valid input.
- `web_ui.hosting` now accepts only `"CloudFront"` and `"APIGateway"`. Passing
  `"ALB"` fails at plan time with a pointer back to this document.

If you never set `web_ui.hosting = "ALB"`, nothing here applies to you — the
shipped `removed` blocks are inert and your plan is unaffected.

### Which path applies to you

```bash
# Do you have ALB resources in state?
terraform state list | grep -E 'module\.web_ui_alb|aws_s3_bucket_policy\.web_ui_alb'
```

- No output → nothing to migrate. Upgrade normally.
- Output → pick the recommended path or the direct-upgrade path below.

### Recommended path: migrate before you upgrade (no state surgery)

Do this on your **current** (v0.5.16-tf.x) version, while `modules/web-ui-alb/`
still exists. Terraform destroys the ALB resources through the module source it
already has, which is the cleanest possible decommission — a plain
`count = 0` destroy, no `removed` blocks, no state edits.

1. Back up state first.

   ```bash
   terraform state pull > state-backup-pre-v0.6.4.json
   ```

2. In your root configuration, switch hosting to CloudFront and drop the `alb`
   block:

   ```hcl
   web_ui = {
     enabled = true
     hosting = "CloudFront"   # was "ALB"
     # alb = { ... }          # delete this block
   }
   ```

   If you would rather not run the Web UI at all in this environment, set
   `enabled = false` instead.

3. Plan and review. You should see the ALB stack being destroyed and, if you
   chose CloudFront, a distribution plus its bucket policy being created.

   ```bash
   terraform plan -out=tfplan-drop-alb
   terraform show tfplan-drop-alb | grep -E '^  # '   # review every address
   terraform apply tfplan-drop-alb
   ```

4. Point DNS away from the old ALB hostname. If you had a Route 53 alias or CNAME
   at `alb_dns_name`, update or delete it now.

5. Upgrade the module reference to `0.6.4-tf.0`, run `terraform init -upgrade`,
   and plan. The ALB is already gone, so this plan contains no ALB changes.

### Direct-upgrade path: let the shipped `removed` blocks destroy the ALB

If you upgrade straight to v0.6.4-tf.0 without the intermediate apply, the
module directory is no longer present — so Terraform cannot plan the destroy from
the module source. The root file `removed-v0-6-4.tf` handles this: it declares

```hcl
removed {
  from = module.web_ui_alb
  lifecycle { destroy = true }
}

removed {
  from = aws_s3_bucket_policy.web_ui_alb
  lifecycle { destroy = true }
}
```

`destroy = true` means the real infrastructure is **decommissioned**, not merely
dropped from state.

1. Confirm Terraform >= 1.7 and back up state.

   ```bash
   terraform version
   terraform state pull > state-backup-pre-v0.6.4.json
   ```

2. Remove `web_ui.alb = { ... }` from your configuration and set
   `web_ui.hosting` to `"CloudFront"` (or `"APIGateway"` once that mode is
   wired). Leaving `"ALB"` in place fails validation:

   ```
   web_ui.hosting = "ALB" was removed in v0.6.4 (upstream deleted ALB hosting).
   Use "APIGateway" for a VPC-capable private posture, or "CloudFront".
   See docs/migration-v0.5.16-to-v0.6.4.md.
   ```

3. `terraform init -upgrade`, then plan and **read the destroy list**.

   ```bash
   terraform plan -out=tfplan-v0.6.4
   terraform show tfplan-v0.6.4 | grep -E '^  # '
   ```

   Expect roughly this shape (exact names depend on your `prefix`):

   ```
   # module.genai_idp_accelerator.aws_s3_bucket_policy.web_ui_alb[0] will be destroyed
   #   (because aws_s3_bucket_policy.web_ui_alb is not in configuration)
   # module.genai_idp_accelerator.module.web_ui_alb[0].aws_lb.this will be destroyed
   # module.genai_idp_accelerator.module.web_ui_alb[0].aws_lb_listener.https will be destroyed
   # module.genai_idp_accelerator.module.web_ui_alb[0].aws_lb_listener_rule.root will be destroyed
   # module.genai_idp_accelerator.module.web_ui_alb[0].aws_lb_listener_rule.catch_all will be destroyed
   # module.genai_idp_accelerator.module.web_ui_alb[0].aws_lb_target_group.s3 will be destroyed
   # module.genai_idp_accelerator.module.web_ui_alb[0].aws_lb_target_group_attachment.s3["..."] will be destroyed
   # module.genai_idp_accelerator.module.web_ui_alb[0].aws_security_group.alb will be destroyed
   # module.genai_idp_accelerator.module.web_ui_alb[0].aws_security_group.endpoint will be destroyed
   # module.genai_idp_accelerator.module.web_ui_alb[0].aws_vpc_security_group_ingress_rule.alb_from_cidrs["..."] will be destroyed
   # module.genai_idp_accelerator.module.web_ui_alb[0].aws_vpc_security_group_ingress_rule.endpoint_from_alb will be destroyed
   # module.genai_idp_accelerator.module.web_ui_alb[0].aws_vpc_security_group_ingress_rule.endpoint_from_lambda[0] will be destroyed
   # module.genai_idp_accelerator.module.web_ui_alb[0].aws_vpc_security_group_egress_rule.alb_to_endpoint will be destroyed
   # module.genai_idp_accelerator.module.web_ui_alb[0].aws_vpc_security_group_egress_rule.endpoint_to_alb will be destroyed
   # module.genai_idp_accelerator.module.web_ui_alb[0].aws_vpc_security_group_egress_rule.lambda_to_endpoint[0] will be destroyed
   # module.genai_idp_accelerator.module.web_ui_alb[0].aws_vpc_endpoint.s3 will be destroyed
   ```

   Verify that **only** `web_ui_alb` addresses appear in the destroy list. If any
   stateful resource (DynamoDB table, S3 bucket, Cognito pool) shows up, stop and
   investigate before applying.

4. Apply, then clean up DNS pointing at the old ALB hostname.

   ```bash
   terraform apply tfplan-v0.6.4
   ```

### Option: forget the ALB instead of destroying it

If you want to keep the load balancer — to reuse it for something else, or to
retire it on your own schedule — do **not** let `destroy = true` run. Either:

- Edit your local copy of `removed-v0-6-4.tf` and change `destroy = true` to
  `destroy = false` in both blocks before planning. Terraform then drops the
  resources from state and leaves the infrastructure in place.
- Or drop them from state directly, before the upgrade plan:

  ```bash
  terraform state rm 'module.web_ui_alb'
  terraform state rm 'aws_s3_bucket_policy.web_ui_alb[0]'
  ```

Either way, the ALB, target group, listener, security group, and S3 interface VPC
endpoint become unmanaged: Terraform stops tracking them and you are responsible
for their lifecycle and cost from that point on.

### Rollback

Both paths destroy infrastructure, so rollback means re-creating it rather than
reverting state. To revert:

1. Restore the pre-upgrade module version and configuration (including the `alb`
   block).
2. `terraform apply` — the `web-ui-alb` module re-creates the ALB, target group,
   listener, security group, and S3 VPC endpoint. The ALB DNS name and hosted
   zone ID will be new, so DNS records must be repointed.
3. `state-backup-pre-v0.6.4.json` is a reference for the previous resource ids;
   do not push it back with `terraform state push` unless the real resources
   still exist with those exact ids.

## API Gateway Web UI hosting

### What it is

`web_ui.hosting = "APIGateway"` is the replacement for the removed ALB mode. The
React SPA is served as an **S3 proxy on the same API Gateway REST API** that
carries the `/op/{field}` data transport:

```
GET /            -> s3://<web-app-bucket>/index.html   (SPA shell)
GET /{proxy+}     -> s3://<web-app-bucket>/{proxy}      (assets)
POST /op/{field}  -> dispatcher Lambda                  (data transport)
```

Because the UI and the API share one REST API and one stage, the UI
**inherits the API's network posture for free**:

- `api.api_gateway_visibility = "PRIVATE"` makes the UI reachable only through
  the `execute-api` interface VPC endpoint — a VPC-only Web UI with no
  CloudFront, no ALB, no ACM certificate, and no S3 VPC endpoint.
- `api.waf_allowed_ipv4_ranges` attaches the same WAFv2 WebACL to the stage that
  protects the API, so the IP allow-list covers the UI too.

The SPA is reached at the REST API base URL (the `api_base_url` output, which
ends in `/api`). CloudFront hosting remains the default and is unchanged.

### Switching to it

```hcl
web_ui = {
  enabled = true
  hosting = "APIGateway"   # was "CloudFront" or the removed "ALB"
}

api = {
  enabled = true           # REQUIRED — the SPA is served BY the REST API

  # Optional: VPC-only UI + API.
  # api_gateway_visibility      = "PRIVATE"
  # api_gateway_vpc_endpoint_id = "vpce-0123456789abcdef0"
}
```

`web_ui.hosting = "APIGateway"` with `api.enabled = false` is rejected by the
`web_ui_apigateway_hosting_requires_api` check — there would be no REST API to
serve the SPA from.

### The UI is built with a different base path

API Gateway serves the SPA under the stage prefix `/api`, so the UI is built with
Vite `base = /api/` in this mode (`VITE_UI_BASE_PATH`, mirroring upstream). Asset
URLs are emitted as `/api/assets/...` and resolve through the `{proxy+}` route.
Flipping `web_ui.hosting` changes that value, which changes the build hash and
triggers a UI rebuild automatically — no manual step.

Deep links work without a rewrite-to-`index.html` fallback because the SPA uses
`HashRouter`: client-side routes live in the URL fragment (`/api/#/...`), so they
never reach the server as distinct paths. A genuinely missing asset key correctly
returns 404.

### ⚠️ Switching from CloudFront replaces the web-app bucket

In APIGateway mode the web-app bucket name is derived at the **root** module
(`<prefix>-webapp-<root-generated-suffix>`) instead of from a suffix generated
inside the `web-ui` module. The API module needs the bucket name up front to build
the S3-proxy integration URIs, and taking it from the `web-ui` module output would
create a dependency cycle (`web-ui` already depends on the API module for its
endpoint URLs).

Consequence: **moving an existing CloudFront deployment to APIGateway hosting
plans a replacement of the web-app S3 bucket.**

This is safe. The bucket holds only the compiled static UI assets, which the
build step republishes on the same apply. Nothing user-authored lives there —
documents, configuration, evaluation baselines, and reporting data are all in
other buckets and are untouched.

Review the plan before applying and confirm the only bucket being replaced is the
web-app bucket:

```bash
terraform plan -out=tfplan-apigw-hosting
terraform show tfplan-apigw-hosting | grep -E 'aws_s3_bucket\.' 
```

Deployments that stay on CloudFront are unaffected: with no
`bucket_name_override` the module keeps its original internal suffix, so there is
no bucket churn.

## `EnableHeadless` renamed to `EnableJobsApi` — no action required

Upstream renamed the `EnableHeadless` stack parameter to `EnableJobsApi` in IDP
v0.6.2, because the old name implied it *removed* the Web UI when in fact it
**adds** a Jobs REST API alongside it (a Private API Gateway with `/jobs`
endpoints, a machine-to-machine OAuth client, and supporting Lambdas).

**This rename does not affect the Terraform wrapper**, because the wrapper has
never implemented that Jobs API. It provisions none of the upstream Jobs-API
resources:

- the `api_handler`, `job_tracker`, and `batch_pre_processor` Lambdas
- the Private API Gateway `/jobs` routes
- the Cognito resource server / `client_credentials` OAuth client for
  machine-to-machine access
- the optional SSM-reachable bastion host

There is therefore no `EnableHeadless` or `EnableJobsApi` variable to migrate.

### Do not confuse this with the wrapper's "headless" posture

The wrapper has a *different* concept that happens to share the word. Setting:

```hcl
enable_api    = false
web_ui.enabled = false
```

runs the processors with DynamoDB-only tracking and no UI and no API at all (see
`examples/unified-headless-demo`). That is the opposite of upstream's
`EnableJobsApi`, which is additive and coexists with the UI. Nothing about that
posture changes in this release.

### If you need the Jobs API

It is not available in the wrapper today. Submitting documents programmatically
is still supported by uploading directly to the input bucket, which is how the
wrapper's headless example operates. If a first-class Jobs API matters for your
integration, raise it as a feature request — it is a new subsystem rather than a
migration step, and is deliberately out of scope for this upgrade.

## IAM permissions boundaries are not supported — no action required unless your account requires one

Upstream's CloudFormation templates take an optional `PermissionsBoundaryArn`
parameter and attach it to every IAM role they create, for accounts whose Service
Control Policy requires a boundary on every role. IDP v0.6.1 fixed a bug in that
mechanism (the Feature Platform nested stack neither declared the parameter nor
attached the boundary, so `iam:CreateRole` was denied and the nested stack rolled
back in SCP-enforced accounts).

**That fix does not apply to this wrapper, and the underlying capability is not
implemented here.** Two separate facts:

- The nested-stack forwarding bug has no analogue in Terraform — there are no
  nested stacks. Nothing to forward.
- The wrapper has never supported permissions boundaries at all. Upstream added
  `PermissionsBoundaryArn` to its templates in v0.3.9, so this is a long-standing
  gap rather than something this release introduced or regressed.

### What this means for you

If your account does **not** enforce a boundary-requiring SCP — the common case —
there is nothing to do. This release changes nothing about role creation.

If your account **does** enforce one, this wrapper cannot deploy into it, on this
release or any earlier one. `terraform apply` will fail with `AccessDenied` on
`iam:CreateRole`. Please raise it as a feature request rather than working around
it locally.

### Why it is deferred rather than fixed here

Closing the gap means attaching `permissions_boundary` to all 72 `aws_iam_role`
resources across 12 modules — Terraform has no provider-level default boundary,
so it is per-role — plus a coverage test to keep new roles from silently missing
it (upstream maintains exactly such a test).

It is deferred because it is **purely additive and non-breaking**: an optional
`permissions_boundary_arn` variable defaulting to `null` produces no diff for
anyone who does not set it, so adding it in a later release costs nothing that
adding it now would save. Bundling 72 role modifications into this release, by
contrast, would bury the AppSync and ALB changes that the upgrade plan needs to
make reviewable.

## Configuration ownership: model authority, feature enablement, and operator-edit preservation

These behaviour changes ship together. All are about the Terraform layer no
longer owning configuration it should not own — the governing seam is that the
**config owns pipeline behaviour** (models, per-stage enablement, backends) while
**Terraform owns infrastructure the config cannot express** (bucket ARNs, VPC
wiring, API topology).

### 1. Step models come from the config only (no Terraform model inputs)

**What changed.** Terraform no longer assigns per-stage Bedrock model IDs at
all. The per-step `*_model_id` inputs (`classification_model_id`,
`extraction_model_id`, `assessment_model_id`, `summarization.model_id`,
`evaluation.model_id`) and the global `model_id` backstop are **removed**. Each
stage's model comes from the YAML configuration; a stage the config omits falls
back to the upstream system default. Resolution is now simply:

```
config YAML model  →  upstream system default
```

The per-stage Bedrock IAM grant is derived from the *same* config content (union
across every seeded config — default, additional versions, and managed
baselines), so it can no longer disagree with the model the runtime invokes.
`allowed_bedrock_model_ids` (including `"*"`) remains as the operator escape
hatch for models added post-deploy in the UI.

**Who is affected.** Any deployment that previously set a per-step model
variable or relied on the `model_id` backstop. With the shipped example configs
(which name their models, or inherit the v0.6 system defaults), the effective
models are:

| Step | System default (when the config omits the key) |
| --- | --- |
| classification | `us.amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0` |
| extraction | `us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-5` |
| summarization | `us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-5:1m` |
| assessment (confidence) | `us.amazon.nova-lite-v1:0` |

**To choose a specific model**, set it in the configuration (not in tfvars):

```yaml
classification: { model: us.amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0 }
extraction:
  model: us.amazon.nova-pro-v1:0
  confidence: { model: us.amazon.nova-lite-v1:0, escalation_model: us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-5:1m }
summarization: { model: us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-5:1m }
evaluation: { llm_method: { model: us.amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0 } }
```

**A YAML typo now fails at plan.** Because a config model ID flows into an IAM
ARN, `terraform plan` validates each resolved model ID's shape and fails naming
the step and value, rather than deferring the problem to an `AccessDenied` at
invoke time.

### 1b. Feature enablement comes from the config, not Terraform toggles

**What changed.** Whether the processing pipeline provisions summarization,
evaluation, rule validation, the HITL branch, and the BDA-as-OCR backend is now
derived at plan time from the configuration, not from duplicate Terraform
toggles. Removed inputs and their config replacements:

| Removed Terraform input | Now set in the config |
| --- | --- |
| `processor.summarization.enabled` | `summarization.enabled` |
| `evaluation.enabled` | `evaluation.enabled` |
| `processor.enable_rule_validation` | `rule_validation.enabled` |
| `processor.enable_hitl` (pipeline HITL branch) | `hitl.enabled` |
| `processor.enable_bda_ocr_backend` | `ocr.backend: bda` |

`var.evaluation.baseline_bucket_arn` stays a Terraform input — it is the
infrastructure the config cannot express — and a `check` block now requires it
whenever the config enables evaluation. The API-side chat-with-document and
discovery features remain Terraform-controlled (they are API-topology decisions;
`discovery` has no config `enabled` key).

**Why.** This closes a drift class: previously a config could enable
summarization while the Terraform toggle defaulted off, so the summarization
Lambda, role, and `bedrock:InvokeModel` grant were never built even though the
runtime believed summarization was on.

**Limitation (important).** Because these flags gate *resource creation*, they
are read at **plan time** from the config file your deployment loads. Toggling a
feature's `enabled` at runtime in the Web UI / DynamoDB does **not** create or
destroy its Terraform-managed resources — run `terraform apply` against the
updated config file to reshape the deployment. (This is the deliberate IaC
posture; an always-deploy/gate-at-runtime model was considered and rejected to
avoid deployment drift.)

**To keep prior behaviour**, ensure your configuration's sections carry the
`enabled` values you want; the example configs already do.

### 2. The seeder preserves configuration edited in the Web UI

**What changed.** The seeder used to overwrite the active `Config#default` row
unconditionally on every apply (including whenever the seeder Lambda's own source
changed). It now does a read-modify-write:

- **No row yet** → create it.
- **Row unchanged since Terraform seeded it** → update it to the new desired
  config.
- **Row edited by an operator** (diverged from what Terraform last seeded) →
  **left intact**, and the skip is logged in CloudWatch.
- **Row with no provenance marker** (a deployment predating this change) →
  adopted once on the first upgrade apply: Terraform writes the desired config
  and stamps it. **Back up any UI edits before this first upgrade**, because that
  one apply still overwrites the row.

Provenance is tracked in a sibling DynamoDB item, `TerraformSeed#<version>`,
which the runtime never reads (it is not a `Config#*` row).

**Consequence.** `terraform apply` no longer reasserts configuration once the row
has been edited. This is the intended fix, but it is a visible behaviour change
if you relied on apply-as-reset.

**Divergence is coarse.** *Any* edit to the row freezes the whole row against
future Terraform configuration updates — Terraform will not push a changed
`config` into an edited row until you force it. Adopting new upstream config
defaults on an edited deployment therefore requires the force procedure below.

### Force procedure (reassert Terraform's configuration over an edit)

There is no module input for this — it is a deliberate, one-off manual action so
it cannot be left on and silently re-clobber edits on every apply. To discard the
operator edit and reassert Terraform's desired config (also the way to adopt the
new model-authority defaults on a deployment whose row was already edited):

```bash
# 1. Delete the provenance marker so the seeder treats the row as a fresh adopt.
aws dynamodb delete-item \
  --table-name <your-configuration-table> \
  --key '{"Configuration": {"S": "TerraformSeed#default"}}'

# 2. Force the seeding invocation to re-run (its input hash is otherwise
#    unchanged, so a plain apply would be a no-op).
terraform apply -replace='module.<...>.aws_lambda_invocation.seed_default'
```

The exact resource address is printed by `terraform plan`; it is the
`aws_lambda_invocation.seed_default` inside the processor-configuration module of
whichever processor façade you deploy.
